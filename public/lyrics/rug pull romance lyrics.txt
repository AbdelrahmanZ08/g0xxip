Verse 1]
DM sliding right into my heart
Should've known it was a scam from the start
Your PFP had that rare NFT glow
Now I'm finding out it's just for show
Promised me those gains in your Discord space
Think I downloaded malware from your gaze
[Chorus]
Rug pull romance (yeah)
Should've checked the tokenomics of this dance
Thought you were my degen soulmate chance
Now my wallet's empty, like your promises
(Like your promises)
Rug pull romance
Got me leveraged up on this finance
Thought we'd build our own decentralized advance
Now my copium is running low
And your Twitter's gone ghost mode
[Verse 2]
Sharing alpha secrets, caught up in your shilling
Every "gm" hit different, had me feeling thrilling
Your Bored Ape matched your energy (fr fr)
Till I found out you just right-clicked me
Posting rocket emojis on your every tweet
Now my portfolio's bleeding, and you've hit delete
Should've seen the red flags in your whitepaper
Now I'm down catastrophic, what a player
[Bridge]
You said we'd build like Faze Clan
Stream our love across the land
But you're just another fake account
Farming engagement while I drown
No cap, I thought we had that based connection
Till I saw through your pump and dump reflection
NGMI alone with my L's to hold
While you're out there touching someone else's digital gold
[Chorus]
Rug pull romance (yeah)
Should've checked the tokenomics of this dance
Thought you were my degen soulmate chance
Now my wallet's empty, like your promises
(Like your promises)
Rug pull romance
Got me leveraged up on this finance
Thought we'd build our own decentralized advance
Now my copium is running low
And your Twitter's gone ghost mode
[Outro]
Guess I'll stake my heart somewhere else (somewhere else)
Put my feelings in cold storage
Till I find someone who's really based
Not just another social exploit
(No more rug pull romance)
GG go next, I'm out this stance
(No more rug pull romance)
Ratio'd by reality, it's time to advance
