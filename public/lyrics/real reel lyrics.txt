Red candles falling down
Lost everything around, me/
Your signal cut right through
Now I'm staking it all, on you/
[Chorus]
You've seen scars made, heart breaks
Alone with these ghosts that all fade
Lost at sea, hard waves
But you reel "real" me in when others are fake
Girl, you my ride or die
(Yeah, you my ride or die)
Till the end of time, you were by my side
Till it's all said and done and time has died
You forever make me feel grateful that I'm alive
[Verse 2]
Diamond hands, you and me
Through the volatility
Trading stories after dark
While you're healing all these scars
[Chorus]
You've seen scars made, heart breaks
Alone with these ghosts that all fade
Lost at sea, hard waves
But you reel "real" me in when others are fake
Girl, you my ride or die
(Yeah, you my ride or die)
Till the end of time, you were by my side
Till it's all said and done and time has died
You forever make me feel grateful that I'm alive
[Bridge]
Been rugged before (before)
But you're worth falling for (for)
[Final Chorus]
You've seen scars made, heart breaks
(Heart breaks)
Lost at sea, hard waves
(Hard waves)
Girl, you my ride or die
Till the end of time, you were by my side
Till it's all said and done and time has died
You forever make me feel grateful that I'm alive
