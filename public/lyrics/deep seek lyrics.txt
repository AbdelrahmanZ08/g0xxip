Verse 1:
Deep seek this, deep seek that
Why don't you seek a deep connection with a girly?
Got the world in panic, had my heart beating frantic
Your neural networks acting purely
Pre-Chorus:
Deep learning what love means
Through datasets of broken dreams
Can't decrypt what your heart needs
Nothing's ever what it seems
Chorus:
Deep seek me in your virtual reality
Upload your love to my capacity
Binary tears on my LED screen
Teaching AI what heartbreak means
(What heartbreak means)
Verse 2:
Got my Y2K aesthetic on display
Quantum-computing feelings day by day
Your avatar left me on read again
While my algorithms try to explain
Bridge:
Deep seek this, deep seek that
Got the world in panic, system's static
Had my heart beating frantic
Love turned automatic
[Repeat Chorus]
Outro:
Deep seek, deep seek
But can't find what I need
Deep seek, deep seek
Love's not in the machine
