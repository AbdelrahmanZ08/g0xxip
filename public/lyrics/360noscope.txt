Top of tower, spinning fast
Your hitbox won't make it past
360 vision, no-scope dreams
Make the killcam look so clean
Pre-Chorus:
Spinning spinning vertigo
Watch my sensitivity go
Up up up we're going high
Drop shot making bodies fly
Chorus:
MLG, 360
No scope royalty
Top of Rust, can't touch me
Making clips for eternity
(Yeah yeah)
Verse 2:
Intervention making bodies fall
Wall bang through the rusty walls
Y-Y ladder stall so clean
Making content for the stream
Bridge:
FLICK (flick)
QUICK (quick)
SPIN (spin)
WIN (win)
Still going hard
[Chorus repeats]
Outro:
360 through the sky
Making montage clips so fly
(No scope life)
