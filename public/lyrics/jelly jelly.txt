Sweet like honey when I trade
Got them watching every play
Jelly jelly of my ways
All these haters in my space
(In my space)
[Pre-Chorus]
You can taste it in the air
All that sugar everywhere
They so bitter while I shine
Getting sweeter all the time
[Chorus]
Jelly jelly of my moves (so sweet)
Jelly jelly, what's the use? (can't beat)
Watch my chart go up up up
While you're feeling stuck stuck stuck
Jelly jelly baby
Like strawberry candy
Jelly jelly honey
Can't buy what I got with money
[Post-Chorus]
(Spoken cutely)
"Aww, you're jelly? That's so cute!"
[Verse 2]
0x0x on display
Got my tokenomics laid
Jelly of my protocol
While I'm living sweet through all
(Sweet through all)
[Bridge]
Sugar-coated alpha leaks
Got them bitter for weeks
Try to copy, try to paste
But they cannot match my taste
Dripping sweet
Like digital candy
While they stay salty
In their feelings, yeah
[Chorus]
Jelly jelly of my moves (so sweet)
Jelly jelly, what's the use? (can't beat)
Watch my chart go up up up
While you're feeling stuck stuck stuck
Jelly jelly baby
Like strawberry candy
Jelly jelly honey
Can't buy what I got with money
[Outro]
(Whispered playfully)
Stay jelly, stay sweet
While I make my own heat
Guess that's why they call it
Jelly jelly...
(Giggled)
Tastes like success ox
