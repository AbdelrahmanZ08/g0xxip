[Verse 1]
They say I'm living life in different time zones (Yeah)
My presence split across these digital homes (Yeah)
Reality's bent when I'm logged in too deep (Yeah)
Existing everywhere but can't find my peace (Yeah)
Avatar's living while my body's asleep (Yeah)
These servers hold the pieces that I can't keep, yeah
[Chorus]
Rumor has it I'm everywhere (Everywhere)
Digital fragments scattered in thin air
Rumor has it I've lost control (Lost control)
Living life through each digital role
But they don't know, no they don't know
[Verse 2]
Got profiles spinning like they're vinyl discs (Yeah)
Each one showing different sides of what I miss (Yeah)
They say I'm online but I can't be found (Yeah)
My data's floating but I'm system down (Yeah)
Everybody's got a piece of who I am (Yeah)
But none of them know the truth behind this scan, yeah
[Chorus]
Rumor has it I'm everywhere (Everywhere)
Digital fragments scattered in thin air
Rumor has it I've lost control (Lost control)
Living life through each digital role
But they don't know, no they don't know
[Bridge]
They think they know me from my status updates
But I'm just codes and encrypted mistakes
Living life in multiple dimensions
Lost myself in all these extensions
Yeah, yeah
