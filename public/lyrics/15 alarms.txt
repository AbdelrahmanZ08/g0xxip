[Verse 1]
Fifteen alarms / one minute apart
Brown noise drowning out / my racing heart 
Shower running / coffee brewing
Toast forgotten while / I'm viewing 
All the things / I need to do
Before you're running / out the door too
Morning chaos / in full bloom
But I wouldn't change / a single move

[Chorus]
Leave the coffee / on the counter
Don't worry / I'll lock the door
Lipstick on the wine glass / you had the night before
Picking up after you / is just picking you after all
Wondering if you're collecting me too / these days

[Guitar Solo 1]

[Verse 2 ]
Watch your dot move / cross the screen
Every turn and / in between
Call me up just / to talk away
Derail my whole / working day
Check the list once / check it twice
Making sure you're / doing alright
Should drive me crazy / but I find
I'm always waiting / right outside

[Guitar Solo 2 - peak intensity, raw emotion]

[Bridge]
All these little things / you do
Leave traces I can / hold onto
Maybe that's why / I don't mind
Picking up these pieces / of our lives

[Final Chorus]
Leave the coffee / on the counter
Don't worry / I'll lock the door
Lipstick on the wine glass / you had the night before
Picking up after you / is just picking you after all
Wondering if you're collecting me too / these days
