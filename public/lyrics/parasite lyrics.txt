Empty promises like credit cards
Maxed out on sympathy
You call when your world falls apart
But never listen to me
Screen lights up with your SOS
Three AM, right on time
Funny how you disappear when
I'm the one who needs a lifeline
Chorus:
Parasites in designer clothes
Taking everything I grow
Empty hands when I'm falling low
But you're first in line for the show
Yeah, you're first in line for the show
Verse 2:
Table's full at your victory feast
But when I'm starving, you're gone
Friendship's just a currency
That you spend until it's withdrawn
Got your hand out like it's muscle memory
But your arms don't know how to hold
Now I'm learning that sometimes lonely
Is better than fool's gold
Bridge:
Been giving out pieces of my soul
To people who collect the toll
But never pay their own
Time to cut these shadows loose
'Cause I've got nothing left to lose
Except these heavy chains you chose
[Chorus repeats]
Outro:
Parasites in designer clothes
Taking, taking as I go
Now I know, yeah, now I know
